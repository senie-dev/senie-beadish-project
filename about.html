    <h2>Who are we</h2>
    <p>BeadWORKS creates opportunities for pastoralist women in northern Kenya to translate their traditional skills into much-needed income. BeadWORKS, a social enterprise of the The Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT),is part of a powerful and growing movement to transform lives. By promoting peaceful community partnerships, we are committed to conserving natural resources and wildlife through self-governed, community-owned conservancies and sustainable, social and ethical enterprise.
        When women have reliable incomes which are independent of unpredictable rainfall, communities and wildlife are able to thrive â€“ together.
